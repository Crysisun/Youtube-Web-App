This is a simple Youtube like web application building with the React.
## Getting Started
I used the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to initialize this app.
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the Node.js installed, after you install the Node, NPM will also be included.
### Clone 
```
git clone https://github.com/Crysisun/Youtube-Web-App.git
```
### Run the app

cd Youtube-Web-App
npm start
```
* Open the client at http://localhost:3000/
* The web app will show up, you can search by typing in keywords in the search bar, the search bar will automatically detect the keywords you type in every 3 seconds, and you can choose videos from the side video list.
